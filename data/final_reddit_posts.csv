This heat escapes the building and to the outside. Where would the energy go next and what would its next form be? 

Searching on the internet for an answer gave another ‘where does the energy go’ thought - the example given was a car with stored chemical energy, which is then converted into kinetic energy via the engine to move the car. Where does this energy then go?

****

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point.

"AskScience AMA Series: We have used AI algorithms to discover antibiotics in extinct organisms, ask us anything!","Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest threats facing humanity and novel antibiotics are urgently needed. To fast-track new antibiotics, we have developed a new AI model. Our system, APEX, is the culmination of several years of work, and builds on decades of prior research developing sequencing methods for ancient genetic material. This deep learning model has enabled the discovery of a whole new world of antibiotics by mining all extinct organisms known to science (the ""extinctome""). Through a process we have termed ""molecular de-extinction"", APEX has successfully resurrected numerous antibiotic compounds found in creatures from the past such as the woolly mammoth. Many of the compounds were effective both in vitro and in two different preclinical mouse models and the activity of the lead hits was comparable to the standard-of-care antibiotic polymyxin B. Molecules discovered by APEX, such as neanderthalin, mammuthusin, mylodonin, elephasin, megalocerin, and hydrodamin, now represent preclinical antibiotic candidates.

Altogether, our AI efforts have greatly accelerated antibiotic discovery. With traditional methods, it takes up to 6 years to discover new preclinical candidates. With AI, now we can discover hundreds of thousands of preclinical candidates in just a few hours.

One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

An educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education.

I started to wonder why I was sweating and feeling like I'm dying when my body is 98.6 degrees on the inside all the time? Why isn't a 98 degree temp super comfortable?

How much of astronomy could be rediscovered by somebody with just a telescope and camera?,"Given how much of astronomy was discovered long ago before there were clocks nearly as precise or even calculators I would guess it should be possible to get a lot on your own. If you know that the Earth has an elliptical orbit and is tilted on its axis, by measuring the apparent altitude of the Sun throughout the year you could calculate the length of each day and the equation of time (I think). With a camera and telescope you could take photos throughout a year showing the changing size of the Sun to determine the eccentricity of the orbit. And so on for other factors and the Moon and planets too. Which leads to the question of how far could you get on your own. For example, I believe it should be possible to measure the synodic draconic and anomalistic months so you could get the saros cycle, but could you go further and predict where the Sun and Moon would appear to be for any given place on Earth, therefore letting you predict all eclipses, not just those in a single saros cycle (I would expect the distance to be Moon to be an important factor in this but that might be measurable by either using the distance to the Moon within a single night to vary by approximately the radius of the Earth or by having 2 people 1000s of miles apart and parallax with the stars). The time scales for other planets can be many years as opposed to a month or year for the Moon/Sun so that's why I'm not focusing on that yet.",askscience,1e5qsab

1. They prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. 

2. They prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.

Sounds good to me. 

So yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.

* Other types of masks and filters may be used for air transmitted bacteria and viruses.

"Would the sun getting ""hotter"" be worse than man made climate change?","Ok so the reason I'm asking this is more or less because like several years back an extended family friend claimed that global warming was caused not by human interference, but ""the sun is slowly heating up"". At the time I was too stunned by the sheer gall of such a statement, and now it has dug its way up from the depths of my mind to resurface, like a barnacle on my brain. I don't know if maybe he misspoke or not, nor do I think I could have changed their mind back then (he was going down the conspiracy pipeline like it was the world's greatest slip'n'slide), but just in the one in a millionth chance I ever hear that argument again:

""How much worse would it be if the sun was truly 'heating up' and causing global warming?""

Like I'm assuming it would be impossible first and foremost, but in the case that global warming was caused by a gradual increase of sunrays, how ""over"" would it be for humanity? Since he said it about 4 years ago, if the sun truly was 'heating up' at a regular pace, would we not all be dead by radiation or something by this point in time?

"Ask Anything Wednesday - Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science","Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

For example the prevalence of epicanthic folds in east Asia. I’ve read that it perhaps came about due to better suitability for blocking the glare of the sun, but such a feature doesn’t seem particularly attractive enough nor important enough for survival for it to be as prevalent as it is.

Has there ever been evidence of spatial dimensions beyond the three we can perceive?,"Lately I've become extremely interested in spatial dimensions beyond length, width, and height, reading Flatland, etc.

I was thinking about something recently. If we have a universe of 2D space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. A 3D object casts a 2D shadow. A 3D object moving through the plane of a 2D universe would appear to a 2D being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

We haven't found a 2D plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as I know, We haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""Shadow."" At least, as far as I know.

I've seen some people postulate about 5, 6, even 10 spatial dimensions. But if these dimensions actually existed, shouldn't we have seen, by now, some form of evidence of them? Or have we seen three-dimensional ""shadows"" of four-dimensional objects and I'm just unaware?",askscience,7l1x9j

As I understand it, the Coriolis ""force"" is purely a longitudinal (east/west) effect. As such, it shouldn't have any effect on the north/south component of velocity/momentum/etc. Is this understanding just wrong?

If that is the case, then why should that prevent a mass of air from making the full trip from equator to poll, or vice versa? Sure the direction of travel becomes increasingly deflected, but the the north/south component of that velocity should be unchanged right?

A month ago we made available publicly via the CERN Open Data Portal 300 TB of research data from the CMS Experiment at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. AUA about our open data!,"Hi /r/AskScience!

As the title of the /r/technology post said, we [dropped 300 Terabytes of LHC data to the internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4g3xvx/cern_just_dropped_300_terabytes_of_raw_collider/) a month ago via the [CERN Open Data Portal](http://opendata.cern.ch). The data, from the [Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)](http://cms.web.cern.ch) Experiment, are now in the public domain under the CC0 waiver. The datasets include over 100 TB of data from proton collisions at 7 TeV, making up half the data collected by the CMS detector in 2011. The data are provided in the format that is used by CMS scientists for performing physics analyses. We have also provided 200 TB of simulated data (*Monte Carlo*) generated with the same software version that should be used to analyse the primary datasets. [Read more about the data release.](http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/cms-releases-new-batch-research-data-lhc)

A year and a half ago, when we first launched the CERN Open Data Portal, we conducted an [AMA about the first release of open data on the portal and about open science in general](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2nxwkb/a_few_days_ago_cern_launched_an_open_data_portal/). Today, we want to talk to you not just about our motivations for making such large datasets available openly and the challenges involved in doing so, but also about how our data are being used for research as well as in education.

","Hello everyone,

Technological advancements in fracking, combined with a surge in oil and gas prices in the early 2000s, made it very lucrative to extract shale resources, leading to a drastic boom in the U.S. oil and gas industry.

At that time, the main concerns were: **groundwater pollution** that would threaten drinking water and local ecosystems, **air pollution/greenhouse effect** caused by the release of methane and other pollutants.

**Now, after 10 years of mass exploitation, have there been major pollution reports? What are scientists concerned about?**

Prosthetics: Can someone born without a limb (rather than losing it after birth) use advanced prosthetics controlled by nerves and neural pathways?,"I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  Let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect/genetic condition.  At no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... If he are she is born this way I presume that there is no neural pathways/nerves to dock onto.  I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.

The inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  But one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.

Any thoughts?

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the response everybody!  This is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking... First, let me say that I was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much I understood about this subject at a base level.  To clarify the question, I believe what I was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:

In my state, Illinois, raccoons (and other terrestrial animals, for that matter) are \*\*VERY\*\* rarely infected with rabies, the vast majority of rabies cases are bats. 

I should say, looking up, I discovered this is, I imagine, due to rabies variants, but, my  question is, why does one rabies variant seem to so rarely affect other animals, meanwhile humans seem to easily acquire rabies from so many different species? Are we humans just especially susceptible to many more variants of rabies than other animals are?

"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Matthias Hebrok, and my lab has just published a breakthrough in making insulin-producing cells in a dish. My team at UCSF hopes to one day cure type 1 diabetes with transplantable beta cells made from human stem cells. AMA!","I'm a stem cell biologist and director of the UCSF Diabetes Center. My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg

My lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

One of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

By producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.


I'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. I'll be starting at 9am PST (12 ET, 16 UT). AMA!

How does a butane torch blow out a lighter's flame without igniting the butane from the torch??,"Since butane is highly flammable, I don't understand how making contact with the flame does not light the torch instantly every time. 

Seen in the picture, I hold the lighter slightly away which burns some of the butane from the torch but does not ignite the torch. Sometimes it blows out the lighter entirely and still doesn't ignite. If you hold the lighter directly to the tip, it lights instantly. 

Is it the velocity of the butane from the torch preventing the ignited gas past the lighter from 'catching up' with the origin?

can energy be split into just kinetic and potential? (beginner's question)  ,"**Hi everyone, I'm a beginner physics learner (didn't study it in school), and I have a question:**

From my understanding, **mechanical energy** is the sum of **kinetic energy** (motion) and **potential energy** (position in a field). I also know that energy consists of mechanical energy, but there are other forms like chemical, electrical, thermal, etc.

However, in the Wikipedia article on [Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy#Forms), it says: *""The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways.""*

This confuses me because I thought **total energy** includes more than just **mechanical energy** (which is kinetic + potential energy). What about chemical or electrical energy? How do they fit into the picture if everything is described as kinetic or potential energy? Is this statement just referring to mechanical energy, or does it apply to all forms of energy?

AskScience AMA Series: We have hints of life on Venus. Ask Us Anything!,"An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial ""aerial"" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.

Signs of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.

Details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2015/

We are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery. We will be available on Wednesday, 16 September, starting with 16:00 UTC, 18:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time), 12:00 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time). Ask Us Anything!

So just how important is MHC in mating?,"was reading about rats today and just hoping someone out there can clear this up!! 

the article was talking about how rats choose mates that are immunologically different from themselves (dissimilar MHC). the theory has been stretched to humans. for example: 1995 t-shirt sniff at uni.

my question is: isn’t every organisms MHC and immune system unique? if every organisms is different and no two are indentical then how much weight does this theory hold? is there like a quantifiable scale of difference? 
I’m meaning is there an ideal level of immunological difference? say only 10%, 20%, 30% identical? anyway just how important is MHC in mating behavior?

Do mosquitos hide in predictable locations?,"I've noticed that if there's a mosquito in the room, and I swat at it but fail to kill it, it usually seems to disappear for about 30 minutes before it tries to come after me again.

I'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are. For example, does it actually have a behavior like ""if swatted at, lay low for 30 minutes before trying again?"" Or am I just imagining the correlation? Second, if they do have a ""hide"" behavior, do they choose predictable locations? Do they prefer corners of the room? Areas with less light (do they even use light in making their decisions)? Do they go low to the ground? High on the ceiling? Do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot?

It seems like I usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room, which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white, well-lit wall, it would be a lot easier to hunt them down. This correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play, though, so I'm curious if much is known on this topic.

EDIT: Thank you for the lovely replies so far! I just wanted to clarify that I'm not actually that interested in \*where\* mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense, I'm more interested in how and ""why"" they make their decisions... like which senses do they use most (vision, smell, touch), and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs. hiding, or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey, then go for an attack?

EDIT 2: Well this post blew up! You may notice that it's a bit of a comment graveyard... sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies. The vast majority of replies were either 1) personal tips for hunting mosquitoes, or 2) personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide. 

Precisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article (thank you /u/Hillsbottom!) showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors, and then avoid the source of those odors (people) in the future.

I didn't feel satisfied so I spent a few hours trawling the literature... turns out there's simply no research on this topic! We know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target, but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior. It's not even clear whether there exists a ""hiding"" behavioral program, or if they're just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attraction/aversion biases in response to swats, etc. 

However, after reading up on it I do think it's safe to say that the majority of the hunting/hiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned. It turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for \~2-4 days before they stop and spend several days digesting + laying eggs (they typically repeat this hunt/rest cycle \~3-4 times before they die). Furthermore, a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed, so in reality it typically only feeds on 1-5 people before stopping. Therefore, even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us, from a single mosquito's perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans (less than 10) in its life cycle, and over the course of only a few days. That isn't a lot of data for the mosquito to ""learn"" with. So, if the possible answers to my original question are 1) it's random, 2) they have instinct-driven preferences for hiding, with a lot of variation between regions/species, or 3) they learn where to hide from experience, we can probably rule out #3.

Our observations are the culmination of a 26-year series of ever-more-precise observations of the centre of the Milky Way using ESO instruments. The observations have for the first time revealed the effects predicted by Einstein's general relativity on the motion of a star passing through the extreme gravitational field near the supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way.

My question, is that given that there were basically only single celled organisms on earth, where did the oxygen come from in the first place? Is it bonded in rocks and trapped in the crust, and the phytoplankton were able to free it? Was it dissolved in the ocean? Was it somehow transported from another part of the galaxy such as in an meteor? Was there significantly more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? And if there was carbon dioxide, where did that come?

Does oxygen load onto haemoglobin sequentially or simultaneously?,"Conflicting messages in the textbooks on this one. I understand that co-operative binding occurs, resulting in each sequential O2 bound to the Hb tetramer to be easier to add than the previous. However, both the following seem plausible to me as a consequence of this phenomenon:

1. Hypothesis 1: the majority of haemoglobin exists fully-saturated oxyhemoglobin or fully-desaturated deoxyhaemoglobin, with % saturations being based on a ratio of the two. This is because oxygen will preferentially bind to haemoglobin molecules which have already overcome the relatively high energy barrier required to bind the first oxygen molecule.
2. Hypothesis 2: the % saturation represents a ratio of amount of oxygen carried by the haemoglobin and the amount that could be carried by the haemoglobin. I.e. a population of Hb molecules at 75% saturation would all contain a distribution of oxygen molecules centred on a mean of 3. Under this hypothesis, only the last (fourth) molecule tends to be loaded at the lungs and unloaded at the tissues. 

So which one is it? Both seem plausible. Both are given as explanations in (different) sources. Only the former seems to be compatible with my understanding of how a pulse oximeter works. ",askscience,1d897gf

One X chromosome is inactivated by Lyonization and becomes a Barr Body, the other is expressed. The expressed melanin allele determines the color of the fur produced by the cell.

When a somatic cell divides, the daughter cells express the *same activated X*, and *suppress the same X in the Barr Body*, so the color of the fur of daughter cells is the same its parent cell. 

So we *shouldn't* expect to see a coat where the fur colors are expressed uniformly at random  from the set of two possible alleles.

We should expect contiguous ""islands"" of coloration, from all spacially adjacent descendent cells divided from the earliest progenitor cells, which progenitors selected an X at random to supress.

"If iron loses its magnetism at around 1400°F, how is the earths core magnetic?","After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

Can our eyes detect non-visible light?,"I wear a very thick mask to sleep. It blocks out light really well, and with it on I can't tell when the bedroom light is on or off.

However, this morning with the bright sun shining through my window onto my pillow, I realised that I can tell when my eyes are in direct sunlight, even though what I'm ""seeing"" is still complete blackness. It feels uncomfortable, like looking too close to the sun does (although less intense). Closing my eyes makes very little difference. Putting my hands over my eyes makes the sensation noticeably less intense.

This leads me to wonder, am I picking up on non-visible light that is able to pass through my mask? Do my eyes have some way of detecting strong UV light that's separate from ""vision""? If so, how does this work? Are some blind people also able to perceive direct sunlight?

Do firefighters have to tackle electric car fires differently?,"Compared to petrol or diesel car fires. I can think of several potential hazards with an electric car fire - electrocution, hazardous chemicals released from the batteries, reactions between battery chemicals and water, lithium battery explosions. On the other hand an all-electric car doesn't have flammable liquid fuel.

But do the different hazards actually affect firefighting practice, or do firefighters have a generic approach anyway?

UPDATE 19 June: Wow. Thanks for awesome answers everyone. I'll attempt to do a brief summary:

* It's not a major issue for putting out the initial fire. Water can still be used. A spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.

* It *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. Responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. But non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.

* It's a concern for removing and storing the wreck. Li-ion batteries can reignite after seemingly being extinguished and this can go on for days.

* Vehicle manufacturers provide fire departments with safety information, for example diagrams of where not to cut a vehicle.",askscience,8rqvu5

Why is U-238 used in Fast Breeder Reactors(FBRs)?,"Hello all,

The NRC says that "" fissionable materials also include those (such as uranium-238) that can be [fissioned](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/fission-fissioning.html) *only* with high-energy neutrons.""

and that agrees with this cross-section chart here which shows at higher neutron energies that fission is more likely that Radiative Capture (RC):

[http://nuclear-power.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Uranium\_238.png](http://nuclear-power.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Uranium_238.png)

But then why would we use FBRs to breed - which I assume is radiative capture to convert the U-238 to Pu-239 - Uranium 238 when it has a high cross-section for fission over RC for fast neutrons?

Based on the chart, would it be better to use Thermal Breeder reactors (MSBR?) to breed U-238 to Pu-239?

Also, on a side note, what are the fission products(FP) of Uranium-238? It is said it can fission but the internet only shows data for FPs of U-235.

(Also, anyone here who would be down to talk about nuclear reactors in general? Really interested in the subject)

How do brain signals encode the location of a sensation?,"People can tell where a sensation is (arm vs leg vs back vs foot).

These signals travel to the spinal cord and to the brain.

How do these signals carry the location information of a sensation? For instance, is the signal that results from an electric shock to the arm different than the signal from an electric shock to the foot?

Additionally, there are a lot of other information carried to the brain as well such as pressure, texture , etc. 

Is this something science has figured out? Are there any current attempts to use ML to decode nerve signals?

If nerve signals are ever decoded, then the potential is massive. You can build devices that replicate sensations of certain things.",askscience,1dgztsf

Is this the case?","The observable universe is the light that has managed to reach us in the 13.8 billion years the universe exists. Because light beyond there hasn't reached us yet, we can't see what's there. This is one of the biggest mysteries in the universe today.

But, since the universe is getting older and new light reaches earth, shouldn't that mean that we see more new things of the universe every day.

When new light arrives at earth, does that mean that the observable universe is getting bigger?

How does propane have a GWP of 0.02?,"I come from a trade background so this might be a dumb question.
If GWP is rated against 1 ton of co2. How does propane have a value less than?

There's this [article](https://naturalrefrigerants.com/ipcc-includes-gwps-for-hydrocarbons-in-new-report/) , that says it was assumed due to its chemical formula it was thought to be 3, but it doesn't say how.

Is it that propane isn't reacting in atmosphere to create co2?

Or is that propane has less of a blanketing on the planet due some thermal property?

Black Lives Matter,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

"What is the velocity of the edge of a bubble as it is ""popping""?","Take a bubble - soap/water, milk or otherwise - and initiate a ""pop"" from a single point on the surface. What would be the velocity of the bursting edge, as it propagates away from the initiation point?

[Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNe2Ae5a2c) of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. Notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.

For simplicity, assume a *perfect bubble*:

- Perfectly spherical
- Evenly distributed surface
- No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)
- ""Pop"" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface

It seems intuitive that the *upper limit* would be the **speed of sound** for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping. But I'm unsure what role the [pressure differential](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/127695/why-is-the-pressure-inside-a-soap-bubble-higher-than-outside) might play - if any at all.",askscience,7ficf3

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

Why is it so inefficient about what it does/doesnt store?

I'm still salty about needing to drink water constantly though. I work in a microbiology lab and have a lot of PPE to deal with every time i leave and reenter the lab to drink. I can't even chug a gallon of water and be good for the day; it has to be gradual.

Why do plants never get cancer?,"All humans and most other animals are at risk of getting cancer during their lifetime.But why plants have the privilege of not getting this disease?

&#x200B;

I'm really impressed by most of your responses,but their is a question in my mind that is still bugging me.

When a person gets really old,cancer cells would form in a certain part of his body since his DNA becomes ""weaker""as he got older ,but let's say just in this case that the cancer cells can not move to other parts of his body(Metastasis )to make the situation similar to plants where cancer cells are locked in this position since they have cell walls that surround the cells. Cancer cells would still originate from different parts of his body as he gets older until tumor covers all of  him and he dies.

This case is theoretically possible for a human,but some trees live for thousands of years and it doesn't seem that tumors are covering all of their parts...Why?",askscience,c6pjr3

How do astronauts level things in space/zero gravity?,"Whether they are trying to level something like the equivalent to hanging a picture frame in space or a nondescript surface, how would they go about it?



Surely a situation where astronauts need to level something has occurred, I just can't think of an exact scenario due to lack of knowledge, nor can I find anything online. I know most levels require gravity in order to work. And then it also depends on what they truly define ""level"" as--is something level when it is perpendicular to the force of gravity and/or just parallel to another object? Could they use several gyroscopes and simulate ""gravity"" and creating something like an x and y axis?



Or is ""level"" simply not a property in space? And how do they deal with this?

Does gravity have a range or speed?,"So, light is a photon, and it gets emitted by something (like a star) and it travels at ~300,000 km/sec in a vacuum. I can understand this. Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is ""new gravity"" being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?

I realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case. This is something that's always interested me but I could never wrap my head around.

"AskScience AMA Series: We've discovered that pancreatic cancer is detectable based on microbes in stool, with the potential for earlier screening in the future. AUA!","Hi Reddit! We are Ece Kartal (u/psecekartal), Sebastian Schmidt (u/TSBSchm) and Esther Molina-Montes (u/memmontes). We are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non-invasive (and early) detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples. Ask Us Anything!

Pancreatic cancer is a horrible disease: although few people develop this form of cancer, only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis. This is in part due to late detection: symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages, so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention (surgery and/or chemotherapy). This makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease, yet no approved non-invasive or minimally invasive, inexpensive tests currently exist.

We studied a Spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, the most common form of pancreatic cancer) and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas-healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, an important risk factor for the development for PDAC). We found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for PDAC patients, even in early stages. When combined with a blood serum-based cancer progression (not diagnostic) marker, prediction accuracy increased even further. We confirmed this finding in an independent German cohort, and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict PDAC among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases. Moreover, we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth, pancreatic healthy tissue, pancreatic tumors, and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators.

Our study is freely available online in the journal GUT (Kartal, Schmidt, Molina-Montes, et al; 2022): https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/01/26/gutjnl-2021-324755

A commentary by R. Newsome and C. Jobin in the same issue puts our work into context: https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/02/21/gutjnl-2021-326710

For less formal introductions, check the press releases by one of our funding bodies ([Worldwide Cancer Research](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/news-opinion/2022/march/microorganisms-in-stool-samples-could-offer-new-way-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-early/)) or the lead institutions [EMBL Heidelberg, Germany](https://www.embl.org/news/science/an-international-study-proposes-stool-analysis-for-early-detection-of-pancreatic-cancer/) and [CNIO Madrid, Spain (text in Spanish)]( https://www.cnio.es/noticias/una-colaboracion-internacional-propone-un-analisis-de-heces-para-la-deteccion-temprana-del-cancer-de-pancreas/).

Our work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts. Yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive, non-invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer. Such a screen could initially target risk groups, e.g. above a certain age or with a family history of PDAC. Ideally, with further development and in combination with other biomarkers, our approach might be developed into an actionable diagnosis method in the future. That said, none of us is a medical doctor; we cannot and will not provide any medical advice, and none of what we post here should be construed as such.

I’m realizing my question is actually more specifically “Why does 2° matter so much when the temperature outside varies by far more than that every afternoon?”

I understand that it has impacts with the ocean and butterfly effects. I’m just not quite understanding *how* it’s so devastating, when 2° seems like such a small shift I would barely even feel it. Just from the nature of seasonal change, I’d think the world is able to cope with such minor degree shifts. 

It’s not like a human body where a tiny change becomes an uncomfortable fever. The world (seems?) more resilient than a body to substantial temperature changes, even from morning to afternoon. 

And no, I’m not a climate change denier. I’m trying to understand the details. Deniers, please find somewhere else to hang your hat. I am not on your team.

**Proper Edit 2 and Ninja Edit 3**
I need to go to sleep. I wasn’t expecting this to get so many upvotes, but I’ve read every comment. Thank you to everyone! I will read new comments in the morning. 

Main things I’ve learned, based on Redditors’ comments, for those just joining:

* **Average global temp** is neither *local weather outside*, nor is it *weather on a particular day*. It is the *average weather for the year across the globe.* Unfortunately, this obscures the fact that the temp change is dramatically uneven across the world, making it seem like a relatively mild climate shift. Most things can handle 2° warmer local weather, since that happens every day, sometimes even from morning to afternoon. Many things can’t handle 2° warmer *average global weather.* They are not the same. For context, [here is an XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1732/) explaining that the avg global temp during the ice age 22,000 years ago (when the earth was frozen over) was just ~4° less than it is today. The ""little ice age"" was just ~1-2° colder than today. Each degree in avg global temp is substantial.

* While I'm sure it's useful for science purposes, it is unfortunate that we are using the metric of *average global temp*, since normal laypeople don't have experience with what that actually means. **This is what was confusing me.**

* The equator takes in most of the heat and shifts it upwards to the poles. The dramatic change in temp at the poles is actually what will cause most of the problems. It only takes a few degrees for ice to melt and cause snowball effects (pun intended) to the whole ecosystem. 

* Extreme weather changes, coastal cities being flooded, plants, insects, ocean acidity, and sealife will be the first effects. Mammals can regulate heat better, and humans can adapt. However, the impacts to those other items will screw up the whole food chain, making species go extinct or struggle to adapt when they otherwise could’ve. Eventually that all comes back to humans, as we are at the top of the food chain, and will be struggling to maintain our current farming crop yields (since plants would be affected). 

* The change in global average (not 2° local) can also make some current very hot but highly populated areas uninhabitable. Not everywhere has the temperatures of San Francisco or London. On the flip side, it's possible some currently icy areas will become habitable, though there is no guarantee that it will be fertile land.

* The issue is not the 2° warmer temp. It is that those 2° could be the tipping point at which it becomes a runaway train effect. Things like ice melting and releasing more methane, or plants struggling and absorbing less C02. The 2° difference can quickly become 20°. The 2° may be our event horizon. 

* Fewer plants means less oxygen for terrestrial life. [Precision Edit: I’m being told that [higher C02 is *better* for plants](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth), and our oxygen comes from ocean life. I’m still unclear on the details here.]

* A major part of the issue is the timing. It’s not just that it’s happening, it’s that it’s happens over tens of years instead of thousands. There’s no time for life to adapt to the new conditions. 

* We don’t actually know exactly what will happen because it’s impossible to predict, but we know that it will be a restructuring of life and the food chain. Life as we know it today is adapted to a particular climate and that is about to be upended. When the dust settles, Earth will go on. Humans might not. Earth has been warm before, but not when humans were set up to depend on farming the way we are today.",explainlikeimfive,9mkv8g

AskScience AMA Series: Happy World Breastfeeding Week! We are human milk and lactation scientists hailing from a range of clinical and scientific disciplines. Ask Us Anything!,"Hi Reddit! We are a group of lactation/human milk/breastfeeding researchers. In honor of [World Breastfeeding Week](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-breastfeeding-week/2024), we are here to answer your burning questions about babies, boobs, and breastmilk!

Lactation science is fraught with social complexity. In recent years, tensions between [researchers](https://theconversation.com/breastfeeding-research-improves-lives-and-advances-health-but-faces-conflicts-151820), advocates & [industry](https://www.thelancet.com/series/Breastfeeding-2023) have reached a crescendo that impacts both our work and the lived experiences of breastfeeding families. We believe that this science belongs to everyone, and that engaging the public on this topic is an important part in addressing these challenges. Science should never make anyone feel bad, but instead should inspire awe and curiosity!

World Breastfeeding Week is a global event held in the first week of August every year, supported by WHO, UNICEF and many government and civil society partners. The theme for 2024 is ""Closing the gap: Breastfeeding support for all."" WBW celebrates ALL breastfeeding journeys, no matter what it looks like for you, while showcasing the ways families, societies, communities and health workers can have breastfeeding parents' backs. In recent years, public health experts have been moving from simply ""promoting"" breastfeeding toward ""protecting, promoting, and supporting"" breastfeeding-that is, emphasizing the role of the entire community in creating the conditions that make breastfeeding easier, more accessible, and sustainable for all families who want it.

Today's group hails from biochemistry, epidemiology, microbiology, neonatology, family medicine, nursing, epigenetics, and biological anthropology. We can answer your questions in English, Portuguese, Italian, Farsi, Sinhalese, and Hindi.

We will join from **11-2pm CST / 12-3pm EST (16-19 UT)**. Ask us anything!

EDIT: THANK YOU for your thoughtful questions everybody!! We learned a lot, and had SO MUCH FUN! A few of us commented to each other how thoughtful and informed the questions were! When you spend a lot of time with a topic every day, it’s easy to get a bit up in your head about it, so this was really helpful for us to take a step back and get a sense of what the wider public is thinking about with regards to our work. You gave us a lot to think about, and even got us thinking about future research questions to pursue!  

Some of us will hang back a bit past our “official” end time (3PM EST), and some of us will pop in out throughout the rest of the day and answer any stragglers.

"ELI5: Can someone help translate what's been called ""the most beautiful paragraph in physics""?","Here is the paragraph:

>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Spacetime is a **pseudo-Riemannian manifold** *M*, endowed with a **metric tensor** and governed by geometrical laws. (ii) Over *M* is a **vector bundle** *X* with a **non-abelian gauge group** *G*. (iii) **Fermions** are sections of **(Ŝ +⊗VR)⊕(Ŝ ⊗VR¯)(Ŝ+⊗VR)⊕(Ŝ⊗VR¯)**. ***R*** and ***R*****¯** are not **isomorphic**; their failure to be **isomorphic** explains why the light fermions are light and presumably has its origins in representation difference Δ in some underlying theory. All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the **metric tensor**, the **gauge fields**, and the **fermions** are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.  
>  
>Edward Witten, ""Physics and Geometry""

According to Eric Weinstein (who I know is a controversial figure, but let's leave that aside for now), this is the most beautiful and important paragraph written in the English language. You can watch him talk about it [here](https://youtu.be/vdW9XDBuxjU?t=3079) or take a deep dive into his [Wiki](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Graph,_Wall,_Tome).

Could someone (1) literally translate the paragraph so a layman can grasp the gist of it, switching the specific jargon **in bold** with simplified plain English translations? Just assume I have no formal education in math or physics, so feel free to edit the flow of the paragraph for clarity's sake. For example, something like:

>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Spacetime is a ~~pseudo-Riemannian manifold~~ ***flexible*** ***3-dimension space*** *M*, endowed with a ~~metric tensor~~ **composite list of contingent quantities** and governed by geometrical laws... etc.

 Here is a different [news source](https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/tech/extinct-creature-sightings-piling-australia-130041464.html) which I read a couple days ago that prompted me to think that the number of sightings have increased recently. 

In the article they mention several recent sightings and the fact that there is a team of scientists taking action to further investigate the claims.

More information on the scientists conducting the research can be found [here](https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2017/march/fnq-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger) in a media release from James Cook University. Dr. Sandra Abell and professor Bill Laurence will be leading a team of scientists that will be placing 50 wildlife cameras out in strategic locations to try to catch a glimpse of the creature.

Why exactly are overweight people at higher risk when they get infected with COVID-19?,"I have seen many mentions, that being overweight is one of the risk factors to have more sever case of COVID-19.

Is it related to the fact that overweight people are often less active (don't exercise much, have sedentary lifestyle, etc - so, for example, their respiratory system is more susceptible to the impact of the virus) or does it have something to do with being overweight in general (hormones, metabolism or something else) ? 

&#x200B;

Why do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19.

How do birds survive the incredible cold temperatures of the polar vortex?,"The title says the most of it. I'm in the Midwest right on the Mississippi and to say that its cold out is something of an understatement. I went for a quick walk by the river to see what all the hype was about (I'm from the West coast originally and I've never been in temps anywhere near this cold).

I was outside for all of twenty minutes as tightly and hotly bundled as a human can be and my eyelashes froze and I thought I'd freeze solid if I had to stay outside for an hour. I could hardly see where I was going while I was walking into the wind I had to keep blinking and wiping the ice away.

All the while I saw dozen of birds out flying around, in the few patches of river that hadn't frozen yet and flying in the air above. It was -20 give or take when I went out, and that's peanuts compared to what it was overnight, but these birds clearly survived that. How do they manage it? 

I guess for clarification, I'm talking about gulls, bald eagles and birds I am fairly certain were ducks.

"AskScience AMA Series: Experts are warning that measles are becoming a global public health crises. We are a vaccinologist, a pediatrician and a primary care physician. Ask us anything!","Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to doctors. It spreads through the air. Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  The effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.

Why does North America continues to have such a large amount of deer despite high levels of urbanization and legalized hunting?

However, centuries of overhunting and habitat fragmentation have drastically reduced their numbers to around one hundred thousand, reducing their distribution to the Pantanal, the Cerrado and some isolated spots. Some say as much as 98% of their range has been lost. In fact, many Brazilians nowadays don't even know our country has deers, even though we have 8 species of them. The larger Marsh Deer (*Blastocerus dichotomus)* has also been impacted by the loss of its habitat, large wetlands.

However, despite fragmentating as much of its open ecosystems and deer hunting being legalized to this day, the deer populations of the United States still have millions of individuals, to the point they may cause problems due to overpopulation.

looking for cures made me wonder though, what actually IS the ringing?? is it blood passing through your ear canal? literally just phantom noise my brain is making up? if i fixate on it i can make it extremely loud, to the point it feels like a speaker is playing too loud & hurting my eardrums. can you actual suffer damages to your ear drums from hearing “loud” tinnitus??

I would assume scientists could create a model of how a language was spoken if they were presented with enough voice recordings and their direct transcripts (assuming they had additional information that contextualizes what was written).

A failed chip in one of the onboard computers caused the spacecraft to stop sending any science or engineering data, so the team couldn't even see what was wrong. It was like trying to fix a computer with a broken screen.

But over the course of six months, a crack team of experts from around [JPL brought Voyager 1 back from the brink.](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-voyager-1-resumes-sending-engineering-updates-to-earth) The task involved sorting through old documents from storage, working in a software language written in the 1970s, and lots of collaboration and teamwork. Oh, and they also had to deal with the fact that Voyager 1 [is 15 billion miles (24 billion km) from Earth](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status/), which means it takes a message almost a full day to reach the spacecraft, and almost a full day for its response to come back.

Now, NASA's longest running mission can continue. [Voyager 1 and its twin Voyager 2](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/) are the only spacecraft to ever send data back from interstellar space - the space between stars. By directly sampling the particles, plasma waves, and magnetic fields in this region, scientists learn more about the Sun's protective bubble that surrounds the planets, and the ocean of material that fills most of the Milky Way galaxy.

ELI5: how did pay get so far from the cost of living?,Simply put I was looking at one of those old graphs about how a loaf of bread used to cost a nickel and a person used to get paid a dollar an hour back in the day or something like that and it said that a down payment on a house would cost less than one month pay and you could pay off your house within like five or six years and my thing is I would have to save my entire yearly paycheck to get my first house ( which would have to be a three bedroom because we have kids). So my question is how did the pay of a person get so far from the cost of living? And to clarify that a little further I understand there some Industries where if you forced them to pay employees more they would no longer be profitable/feasible but surely some of them have to be over charging and if it's not a big discrepancy between big time people and companies getting overpaid then where did the money go or is it going?,explainlikeimfive,1jblpk3

Is AMOC collapse going to cause a net temperature drop in Western Europe?,"Hi all,

I've recently seen the likely collapse of AMOC get more and more attention. Some more recent [papers ](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk1189)I've seen on the subject predict a brutal 10 ˙C drop in parts of Europe. Sadly I don't know enought about the subjects to tell this from these papers, but I was wondering: do these predictions include the predicted heating effect of climate change? So... is this a net drop, or something that is going to factor into a gradually warming climate?

While we're at that, all these things going on in the climate system: underwater methane traps, thawing permafrost, AMOC collapse, ice sheet loss, rainforest loss, and all of these affect the climate system... when you read about temperarure anomaly predictions, do those models account for their interplay?

"The Human Genome Project cost $2.7 billion. 20 years later, it costs <$1000 to sequence the genome.

I don't mean this in any sort of combative way–the Human Genome Project had countless benefits that we can't possibly track, and I'd imagine $2.7 billion is a trifle compared to its broader impact. 

My question is just narrowly about the way that genome sequencing has dropped rapidly in cost. Was it fundamentally necessary to first use these exorbitantly pricey methods, which provided the foundation for the future research which would make it affordable? Or are the two questions inherently separate: the Human Genome Project gave us a first, initial glimpse at our mapped out genome, and then a decade later separate technological developments would make that same task much cheaper (as is commonly the case in science and technology).

The ""could we have waited"" in the title is probably misleading–I really don't mean any sort of  value judgment (the project sounds enormously important), I purely mean ""could"" in a narrow hypothetical (not, ""would it have been a good idea to wait"", which I highly doubt).",askscience,hpt7ab

"AskScience AMA Series: We are students and faculty of the Molecular Engineering & Sciences Institute at the University of Washington. The field of Molecular Engineering is growing quickly. As one of only two US schools offering this program, we wish to spread awareness about our exciting field! AUA!","We are graduate students and faculty from the University of Washington Molecular Engineering and Science (MolES) PhD program. Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs to appear in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though our program only began in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!

Molecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the behavior of something by precisely altering it on a molecular level - given knowledge of how the molecules in that ""something"" interact with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are limited only by your imagination! 

Molecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. We would like to spread awareness about its applications, as well as the exciting opportunities that come with it. 

As a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to broaden the general awareness of our discipline!

AskScience AMA Series: I am an atmospheric scientist at the University of Maryland. My research focuses on Earth system predictability using tools like data science and machine learning. Ask me all your questions about how we use machine learning to understand climate and weather extremes!,"Hi Reddit! I am an atmospheric scientist (and former cable news meteorologist) here to answer your questions about climate and weather extremes. 

**Maria Molina** is an assistant professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at the University of Maryland. Her research focuses on the application of machine learning tools, such as neural networks, and numerical modeling systems to answer pressing questions in the domains of climate and extremes.

She leads the PARETO (Predictability and Applied Research for the Earth-system with Training and Optimization) group. Some examples of problems they are tackling include extending our understanding of Earth system predictability, parameterizing subgrid scale processes in Earth system models, and uncovering multi-scale patterns in the climate system.

Molina is also affiliated with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado and serves as an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences at North Carolina State University. She is Vice-Chair of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) Committee on Artificial Intelligence Applications to Environmental Science, a member of the WCRP Scientific Steering Group for the Earth System Modelling and Observations (ESMO) Core Project, a member of the AMS Board on Representation, Accessibility, Inclusion, and Diversity (BRAID), and an Academia Ambassador for the AMS Committee for Hispanic and Latinx Advancement (CHALA).

Molina received her doctorate in Earth and ecosystem science from Central Michigan University in 2019.

**Dean Calhoun** is a first-year Ph.D. student and graduate research assistant in UMD's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science.

Previously, he worked as an associate scientist with the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory developing NOAA's Unified Forecast System Mid-range Weather and S2S applications. At UMD, he hopes to apply AI/ML methods to explore interannual-to-interdecadal coupled earth system dynamics like ENSO, NAO, and PDO and their impacts on global hydroclimate predictability.

**Jonathan David Starfeldt** is starting the Ph.D. track at the University of Maryland's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Science in Fall 2024. He received his B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Spring 2024 with a double major in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and Data Science with a certificate in Computer Science. During his Ph.D., he hopes to build machine learning tools that give us information about how weather extremes, like urban heat and hurricanes, are being altered in our changing climate. 

**Manuel Titos** is a visiting postdoctoral researcher from the University of Granada's Department of Signal Processing, Telematics, and Communications. His current work focuses on characterizing, quantifying, and assessing source parameters of wildfires and explosive volcanic eruptions for operational simulations of contaminant dispersion.

Daile serves on the Board of Directors for the African Centres for Lightning and Electromagnetics Network and is a U.S. National Lightning Safety Council member. She also serves on the World Meteorological Organization's Committee on Weather and Climate Extremes and helped certify two new megaflash lightning records in 2022. Daile and her co-author Ronald Holle published an educational booklet ""So You Think You Know Lightning"" in 2017 and a Springer book ""[Flashes of Brilliance: The Science and Wonder of Arizona Lightning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-19879-3)"" in 2023. In 2024, Daile took the lead in organizing the 2024 International Lightning Safety Day event to mitigate lightning hazards worldwide.

**About Lightning Safety Awareness Week:** National Lightning Safety Awareness Week started in 2001 to call attention to lightning being an underrated killer. Since then, U.S. lightning fatalities have dropped from about 55 per year to less than 30. This reduction in lightning fatalities is largely due to the greater awareness of lightning danger and people seeking safety when thunderstorms threaten.

I'll be on from **2 to 4 p.m. ET (18-20 UT)** - ask me anything!

ELI5: Positional asphyxiation in babies,"I feel so stupid for needing to ask this but I truly do not understand. 

From what I’ve been told and seen a babies airways can be cut off by their head being too far back or when their chin is touching their chest. This is partially why it’s recommended they sleep on a hard/flat surface, but I don’t understand if my baby is laying on my bed or couch flat on her back and her neck is perfectly fine how is this still risk for positional asphyxiation? 

I’ve also seen some people mention rebreathing but I don’t see how this can possibly happen if she’s on her back. 

Additionally, wouldn’t baby wearing also be considered risky?

"AskScience AMA Series: Hi Reddit - we are back again! We are group of engineers, scientists, innovators, technologists, digital experts, and designers with a collected 45 PhDs / Professors and 35 members representing national science or engineering institutions.","**TL;DR:**

We're back with our third time back doing an AMA - we had such a blast last time that we wanted to come back again to answer whatever science or technology questions Reddit wants to throw our way. So please ask us any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.

Our goal is simply to advance everyone's understanding of science, engineering, and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.

**More info / Longer read:**

CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We're a volunteer group comprising over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity of thought and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social, and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being nearly 100!)

There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today's global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine 'truth' and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!

Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren't able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.

So, Reddit... Ask us anything!




CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however some of the people standing by to answer comments are:

Is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?,"I have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: 

**1. The Moon**

>u/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**

> u/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth’s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202). 

**3. Moldavite – Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite](https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. Hydrogen and Helium** 

>u/SlowerThanLightSpeed: ""Jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_escape#Jeans\_Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   
>  
>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\[10\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\[10\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\[11\] 

**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

Patrick Whelley is a geologist who studies volcanic and aeolian processes and products on terrestrial planets. His work uses a combination of remote sensing and in-situ observations. He has a B.S. and M.S. from Arizona State University and a Ph.D. from the University at Buffalo, SUNY and currently works as a research scientist with the University of Maryland on a cooperative agreement at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. In the field, he collects high-resolution topographic data using a terrestrial laser scanner. The data inform volcanic mapping and provide ground truth for remote sensing measurements. Patrick uses remote sensing data to characterize explosive volcanic stratigraphy on Mars. His work has implications for volcano hazard mapping, on Earth, and for interpreting volcanic histories of the terrestrial planets.

I made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http://imgur.com/a/C84eq)

 *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*

 * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * On the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?


**To recap**

It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

AskScience’s concerns regarding Reddit’s API changes,"In April 2023, [Reddit announced they would begin charging for its application programming interface (API)
access](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/18/technology/reddit-ai-openai-google.html).

API is used to allow different applications to interact with each other. We are a heavily moderated subreddit, and we use API access for moderation, AMA organisation, and insights into our community. We are using community-driven tools which use the API in order to make management of a community as large as /r/askscience practical for our group of volunteer moderators.

At the same time, we recognise both Reddit's mission as a corporation, as well as the dangers and risks arising from access to the API. Reddit is looking for ways to [monetize its user-generated content](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/upcoming-reddit-blackout-and-future-third-party-applications); the Times article linked above notes has been used to train high-profile machine learning models like OpenAI's.

While Reddit administration has mentioned [free access for moderation tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/), we believe their current approach of gatekeeping access based on arbitrary and indiscriminate rate limiting has several shortcomings:  
It disproportionately impacts people who use Reddit with accommodations, such as screen readers: Reddit has stated that [accessibility-focused apps will be exempt from the new restrictions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/reddit-makes-an-exception-for-accessibility-apps-under-new-api-terms/) but has offered little clarity on what that means for this rapidly-approaching change  
It does not reflect Reddit’s promise to [support moderation
  tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/141oqn8/api_updates_questions/)  
It does not establish clear and concise criteria for what is legitimate API usage  

We also remain cognisant of Reddit’s past promises to [improve communication with
moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/) and build tools for us to improve search and combat hateful rhetoric, anti-vaccination, and COVID denialism. While Reddit has banned hate speech and banned communities spreading science denialism, we feel they have not delivered on moderation tools and support. We feel that 3rd-party tools still offer superior support for moderation as well as accessibility features.

Everyone in the /r/askscience community contributes to its quality and longevity by volunteering their time and expertise to question, answer, and moderate scientific discussion. We feel the Reddit administration does a disservice our passion for large-scale, high-quality science communication by [pursuing a unilateral and opaque
direction](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/). This damages our community and ultimately Reddit itself by severing the trust we place upon it as a platform for science education and outreach.

AskScience AMA Series: We are scientists here to discuss our breakthrough results from the Event Horizon Telescope. AUA!,"We have captured the first image of a Black Hole. Ask Us Anything!

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole. Today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, EHT researchers have revealed that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.

The image reveals the black hole at the centre of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun

- Press conference right now! [eso.org/live](https://www.eso.org/live/).
- Details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/eht

Now let’s say the knob was at high when water started boiling which is typically 100C. So once I turn it to low, does the temperature go down or does the low knob keep it at 100C?

What is Zirconium Ceramic?,"I really wasn't sure if this should be in earth science or chemistry, but I figured chemistry gets it to the state that it is used in medically and industrially.  I'll try to be brief because my head hurts now.

Short version, I'm working on a story in a midevil-esque time period and metals are rare and precious in my world.  So with that in mind, I don't want staple weapons that anyone is able to get ahold of to be metal because most metal only the higher class can afford.  From watching too much TV and movies, I know that ceramic blades exist, mostly in the context of people using them to get a weapon past metal detectors.  But ceramics is a large industry in my world, so I decided to look into it, which led me down a rabbit hole of Zirconium Ceramic products, which is all well and good but I'm trying to find out what it *is* and all I'm getting is technical industry jargon that I can't understand.

From what I understand, ceramic=clay.  But Zirconium is metal.  So metal=/=ceramic.  But there is Zirconium Ceramic???

I just need a simple, clear cut, straight forward answer.  Is this Zirconium mixed *into* clay??  Like a powdered form of it is broken down and mixed into clay which is then processed and molded into products?  That's the only explanation I can think of.",askscience,1e5pati

AskScience AMA Series: We have discovered an Earth-mass exoplanet around the nearest star to our Solar System. AMA!,"*Guests:* Pale Red Dot team, Julien Morin (Laboratoire Univers et Particules de Montpellier, Universite de Montpellier, CNRS, France), James Jenkins (Departamento de Astronomia, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile), Yiannis Tsapras (Zentrum fur Astronomie der Universitat Heidelberg (ZAH), Heidelberg, Germany).

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

Why can't I weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down?,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

They're always surprisingly small and would have only housed a small group of men.  The largest one I've seen would have housed a couple hundred.  I was told that some blockhouses close to where I live were used to protect a small settlement from native american raids.  How can small little forts or blockhouses protect from raids or stop armies from passing through?  Surely the indians could have gone around this big house.  How could an army come up to a fort and not just go around it if there's only 100 men inside?

AskScience Panel of Scientists XXVI,"**Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/198hzvn/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxv/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

Does antihydrogen have the same orbital size/shape as hydrogen?,"(not sure if Physics may be a more appropriate flair - I apologize if I mis-flaired this post)

Would anti-hydrogen i.e. the antimatter counterpart of Hydrogen, have the same orbital levels and shapes, as regular hydrogen? Would a more complex structure like anti-oxygen (we haven't synthesized this yet as far as I know - so theoretically) have the same shape/size orbitals as 'normal' Oxygen?

While thinking about this I was also wondering if anti-hydrogen, would be considered an element? (as a side question, would we need to redo the periodic table to accommodate these antimatter elements?)

So could that extra 100 million years have lead to differences we can see/measure today. For example could the west coast have bigger or deeper water aquifers due to the millions of years of hurricanes dumping water inland that the east coast didn't get? could the soil be saltier due to tidal flooding? could there be more offshore oil on the west coast due to the extra 100 million years of whales, sharks, plankton, and other sea life or larger calcium deposits from the extra shellfish species?",askscience,1em9cbe

Edit: just to provide an example of the sort of thing I am thinking about, I am imagining something like a layer of limestone laid down in the Paleozoic, eroded as karst in the Mesozoic, forming a cave perhaps containing stalactites or even fossils of animals that wandered inside and died, then filled in with sediment, buried, and later discovered in the modern day.

"ELI5: If the human body can generate heat in the form of fever when you are sick to protect/defend itself, why doesnt it produce heat during winter to protect against cold?","The highest fever ever recorded according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is 46.5°C. While that seems very excessive and probably is not good for you, why shouldn't/can't your body heat itself perhaps to something like 38-42°C to prevent things like extreme frostbite. The danger of losing limbs or fingers far outweighs the danger of high fever. The human body is already one of the most complex things on this earth, so just warming ourselves up seems like child's play compared to what we are already capable of.

Edit: isnt there already something simillar to this called paradoxical undressing or Hypothermia not to be confused with hyperthermia, where you feel so hot during cold that you undress? If im not mistaken this isnt actual heat tho.",explainlikeimfive,1j5l1wj

"Curious to know what multiple layers on sides of a hill mean? Sea level was there many many years ago?

I have read that these layers represent different eras and we get to know composition of atmosphere during those times by studying these.

However, I'm curious if this also means that hill / rock had water levels touching it?

One eye is completely normal and painless. 

This happened to me when I was driving the other day and I was worried I’d have to pull over on the highway, but when I closed one eye I was able to see with no pain sensation whatsoever with roughly the same amount of light radiation entering my 👁.

"In the Tv series ""Chernobyl"" how realisticaly depicted are the effects of intense radiation exposure?","After the explosion they depict an enormous light projecting from, presumably, the exposed nuclear core, it's depicted like a huge cone of light going up in the sky till the eye can see, would an exposed nuclear core in meltdown emit such a huge amount of light?

Also a man is depicted looking directly into the exposed nuclear core, I presume in full meltdown, right after the explosion, immediately his face turns orange reddish and after a couple of seconds he's seriously sick and vomiting blood, is this accurate?

In general this is how it is depicted all the time, as soon as people get in contact with very high dosages of radiation their skin immediately starts to look red/orange and after a while it bleeds.

But imagine this scenario: an AC circuit with two terminals that are far apart and completely isolated from the outside world.

In this scenario, I wonder if there is still an infinitesimal current that flows. Indeed, if I understand electrostatics correctly, there are still very small displacements of electrons due to the change in voltage and the capacity of the wire.

By extension, if we put a large capacitor on the branch : even in an open circuit, I imagine that we will observe a current for a certain time?

Why do we hear about breakthroughs in cancer treatment only to never see them again?,"
I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

But....how does the actual cash move to balance this out?  Somehow $5,000 actual dollars have to get to the other bank to cover the transaction. 

Or even in deposit $5,000 and then wire transfer it. Electronically my bank says I no longer have $5,000 and my friend's bank says they have $5,000. But somehow my bank has to make $5,000 disappear from their vault. Where does it go?

If the bank holds onto the original $5,000 then money is created, which can't be right. I understand it doesn't matter WHAT $5,000 actually leaves the bank. But somewhere an actual amount of $5,000 physical bills somehow has to leave my bank and arrive at the other bank.

I also leads our effort to administer 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days. Before this, I was SVP and chief health officer at Kaiser Permanente and commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health before that.

I'm Carole Johnson and I'm the national testing coordinator for the COVID-19 Response Team. I previously served as the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Human Services, managing the state's largest agency including Medicaid, child care, food assistance, aging services, and mental health and substance use disorder treatment. For more than five years, I served in the Obama White House as senior health policy advisor and a member of the Domestic Policy Council health team working on Affordable Care Act implementation issues and public health challenges like Ebola and Zika. I also worked on Capitol Hill for members of three key health committees - Senate Finance, House Ways and Means, and Senate Aging - and in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and Services Administration, the Alliance of Community Health Plans, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the American Heart Association.

I'm Tim Manning and I'm the national supply chain coordinator for the COVID-19 Response Team. I'm an emergency manager, doing disaster and emergency response for the past 25 years; I've worked at the local and state level, and served in FEMA for eight years as a Deputy Administrator. I've been a firefighter and EMT, and I know first-hand the importance of having the equipment and supplies you need, when you need it on the front lines of a crisis. Right now, I work with teams across the government - from the Department of Defense to the Department of Health and Human Services - to ensure our country has the supplies we need, not just now but into the future too.

Seas receding In one area and Rising in another nearby? ,"For a theory I'm crafting on the FAR Game series by OKOMOTIVE. I need to know if its possible for seas to rise in one area, and recede in another nearby (at the same time) by significant amounts.

In each of the two games, is depicted two lands, one which has its seas rise and flood it, and another that has its seas recede respectively. They are next to each other and share a sea. This happens over the course of what seems like a half lifetime or more; as In game, you can visually see the advancement of technology over time as society followed the receding water line in the first game.

Some other evidence I gathered in game includes: Depictions of earthquakes, tsunamis and a seismograph from an ancient civilization who seem to have predicted this event, or one similar to it. Volcanic activity and tremors in the game areas between the two land masses, as well as a massive waterfall splitting the ocean in two. The land masses are also at high latitudes with ice burgs and glaciers if that's relevant.

Why my phones touchscreen sometimes registers a touch when in reality my finger is millemeter or two from screen?,"My guess is static electricity since it only happens once in a while and randomly but i am hoping for more insightful explanation.

Edit:
It also usually happens in the middle of typing. It never happened, for me, on first letters I typed. And, I am sure my finger did not touch the screen in a way i just did not feel it. When it happened i was surely away from screen, that is why it always jumps out when it happens. It is always unexpected.

Edit2:
I can surely replicate phone registering very soft touches (without me feeling actually touching it) but those random ones I am experiencing are different, the finger is always a lot further away than when i can register a touch without feeling it by testing. A lot may be very relative term but that is how it feels to me, i am not really sure how far the finger actually is because it usually happens really fast and its hard to measure so small distances with feelings. So, there is a small chance that i am imagining it.

"Cosmological ""Point Nemo"": what is the furthest you can get from any star? And where would such a maximally-isolated location be?","Surely wherever you are there will be a star closer to you than say a billion light years! So what's the actual number of lightyears for this limit, even very roughly?

For example, Wikipedia introduces Point Nemo as follows: ""It represents the solution to the ""longest swim"" problem. The problem entails finding such a place in the world ocean where, if a person fell overboard while on a ship at sea, they would be as far away from any land in any direction as possible."" And the answer for the longest such distance is 2,688 km. Isn't it natural to ask for a similar question about a lost hypothetical interstellar traveler, the longest possible distance to the nearest star if one is stranded somewhere in the observable Universe (hoping for a rough estimate of the answer, of course it won't be remotely as precise)?

The density of intergalactic stars is apparently estimatable, Wikipedia says there are about a trillion in the Virgo cluster - which is exactly what prompted me to ask this question. If we know the place with the lowest density of intergalactic stars, then it's gotta be in it, and if that density is ""about one per [volume]"", then the answer for the furthest you can ever get from a star in the observable Universe is about the cubic root of that [volume].",askscience,1ec0qh9

The James Webb Space Telescope (aka Webb) is the most complex, powerful and largest space telescope ever built, designed to fold up in its rocket before unfolding in space. After its scheduled Dec. 24, 2021, liftoff from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana (located in South America), Webb will embark on a 29-day journey to an orbit one million miles from Earth.

For two weeks, it will systematically deploy its sensitive instruments, heat shield, and iconic primary mirror. Hundreds of moving parts have to work perfectly - there are no second chances. Once the space telescope is ready for operations six months after launch, it will unfold the universe like we've never seen it before. With its infrared vision, JWST will be able to study the first stars, early galaxies, and even the atmospheres of planets outside of our own solar system. Thousands of people around the world have dedicated their careers to this endeavor, and some of us are here to answer your questions. We are:

ELI5: How can the universe possibly be infinitely big,"Assuming the universe started as a singularity and has been expanding since the big bang approximately 13.7 billion years ago, surely it must be a finite size? I don't understand why, in principle, a mathematician couldn't put the required variables (the age of the universe, the rate of expansion, rate of acceleration, fluctuations etc) into a formula and deduce the current size of the universe with some degree of accuracy. We might not know exactly what the values of the variables are to get to the answer, but we could still make a formula and we'd know the answer must be a finite number, surely? For an expanding thing to have an infinite size, it needs an infinite amount of time to get there, and we know the universe hasn't been expanding for an infinite amount of time so therefore it can't be infinitely big. Yet scientists say it might indeed be infinitely big. Please explain how.",explainlikeimfive,1j6utu4

1. Type the number.
2. Recursively take its square root 19 times.

AMA!","Hi Reddit! I’m [Brian Hare](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/people/brian-hare), and I’m here to talk about canine cognition and how ordinary and extraordinary dog behaviors reveal the role of cognition in the rich mental lives of dogs. The scientific community has made huge strides in our understanding of dogs’ cognitive abilities – I’m excited to share some of the latest and most fascinating – and sometimes surprising – discoveries with you. Did you know, for example, that some dogs can  learn words like human infants? Or some dogs can detect cancer? What makes dogs so successful at winning our hearts?
 
A bit more about me: I’m an associate professor at Duke University where I founded and direct the [Duke Canine Cognition Center](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/research/dogs), which is the first center in the U.S. dedicated to studying how dogs think and feel. Our work is being used to improve training techniques, inform ideas about canine cognitive health and identify the best service and bomb detecting dogs.  I helped reveal the love and bond mechanism between humans and dogs. Based on this research, I co-founded [Dognition](https://www.dognition.com), an online tool featuring fun, science-based games that anyone with a dog can use to better understand how their dog thinks compared to other dogs. 
 
Let’s talk about the amazing things dogs can do and why – Ask Me Anything!

1. There is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. When they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.

2. There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness. A nurse discovers her and freaks out and kicks her out of the hospital for her own safety.

**Is actual radiation contamination *that* contagious?** [This article](https://www.livescience.com/13444-radiation-exposure-contagious.html) seems to indicate that it's nearly impossible to deliver radiation via skin-to-skin contact, and that as long as a sick person washes their skin and clothes, they're safe to be around, even if they've inhaled or ingested radioactive material that is still in their bodies.

also yes ants don't have eyes i know that now. i just meant something small that does have eyes.

Edit 2: ok ants DO have eyes.

also why am i on the front page for asking if elephants can see ants? this is the best day ever!

FINAL EDIT: somebody gave me gold, and this has become the third top post ever on askscience... that is not how i was expecting this to go. thank you all!",askscience,6idvam

Carbon in all forests is 638 GtC. Annual carbon emissions by humans is 9.8 GtC (1.5% of 638). Would increasing forests by 1.5% effectively make us carbon-neutral?,"I suppose the broader question is: to what extent is reforestation a viable strategy for halting climate change?

In an effort to extinguish a local mosquito population, up to a billion of these mosquitos will be released in the Florida Keys over a period of a few years. How's that going?",askscience,q011ji

ELI5: What is the difference between a Freudian slip and just making a mistake while speaking?,"The definition is that you accidentally say something that you didn't want to say but secretly thought. How is it different from a genuine mistake?

I can mistake one word for another and I think it's very common. It happened to me in silly situations like accidentally saying I will apply a face cream first and then wash my face even though I wanted to do it in the opposite order. It doesn't mean I secretly planned to change the order. One time I was talking with one person about one product for a long time and then that person asked for it in a shop accidentally instead of asking for the thing she wanted. It doesn't mean anything either. She just had it in her mind because it was a subject of our conversation a few minutes ago.

What's the difference between that and a Freudian slip? On the outside they both appear identical to me. Only the speaker knows which one was that.",explainlikeimfive,1ja7i9c
