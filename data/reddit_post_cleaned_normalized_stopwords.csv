how much of astronomy could be rediscovered by somebody with just a telescope and camera,given how much of astronomy was discovered long ago before there were clocks nearly as precise or even calculators i would guess it should be possible to get a lot on your own if you know that the earth has an elliptical orbit and is tilted on its axis by measuring the apparent altitude of the sun throughout the year you could calculate the length of each day and the equation of time i think with a camera and telescope you could take photos throughout a year showing the changing size of the sun to determine the eccentricity of the orbit and so on for other factors and the moon and planets too which leads to the question of how far could you get on your own for example i believe it should be possible to measure the synodic draconic and anomalistic months so you could get the saros cycle but could you go further and predict where the sun and moon would appear to be for any given place on earth therefore letting you predict all eclipses not just those in a single saros cycle i would expect the distance to be moon to be an important factor in this but that might be measurable by either using the distance to the moon within a single night to vary by approximately the radius of the earth or by having 2 people 1000s of miles apart and parallax with the stars the time scales for other planets can be many years as opposed to a month or year for the moonsun so thats why im not focusing on that yet,askscience,1e5qsab

is there a limit to human digestion,i was arguing with this person on tiktok and was wondering if i am right or not this whole debate started with me claiming that weight gain is different from weight loss because some people cannot physically process all of the calories they eat this got carried away and i claimed that if you ate a pill that had 100000 calories please ignore that this is pretty impossible but its a hypothetical so the possibility of it is unrelated you would absorb some of it and poop out the rest of it as you can only digest a certain amount of calories per hour and the pill will stay in your digestive track for a certain amount of time as it moves down at around a constant speed i think he says that you would die from your body trying to absorb too many calories but i think this wouldnt be possible as you would just poop out whatever you dont absorb as if you could just absorb 100000 calories in an hour it wouldnt make sense as how would you have enough energy to do so please let me know what you think,askscience,1dd9qa0

prosthetics can someone born without a limb rather than losing it after birth use advanced prosthetics controlled by nerves and neural pathways,i understand or at least i think i do to some degree that if someone loses an arm for example cuttingedge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics lets say instead however that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defectgenetic condition at no point have they had an elbow or forearm hand if he are she is born this way i presume that there is no neural pathwaysnerves to dock onto i am sure that technology will continue to advance so i guess i am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches the inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet a video where a little boy maybe a few years old with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling he utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his siblings pacifier and put it in her mouth a very heart warming video many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms but one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them any thoughts x200b edit thanks so much for the response everybody this is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking first let me say that i was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much i understood about this subject at a base level to clarify the question i believe what i was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic that seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles i will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses while i am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics the question is probably more appropriately can someone born without a limb as opposed to losing a limb later in life use myoelectric prosthetics why or why not,askscience,9odirf

do mosquitos hide in predictable locations,ive noticed that if theres a mosquito in the room and i swat at it but fail to kill it it usually seems to disappear for about 30 minutes before it tries to come after me again im curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are for example does it actually have a behavior like if swatted at lay low for 30 minutes before trying again or am i just imagining the correlation second if they do have a hide behavior do they choose predictable locations do they prefer corners of the room areas with less light do they even use light in making their decisions do they go low to the ground high on the ceiling do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot it seems like i usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white welllit wall it would be a lot easier to hunt them down this correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play though so im curious if much is known on this topic edit thank you for the lovely replies so far i just wanted to clarify that im not actually that interested in where mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense im more interested in how and why they make their decisions like which senses do they use most vision smell touch and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs hiding or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey then go for an attack edit 2 well this post blew up you may notice that its a bit of a comment graveyard sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies the vast majority of replies were either 1 personal tips for hunting mosquitoes or 2 personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide precisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article thank you uhillsbottom showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors and then avoid the source of those odors people in the future i didnt feel satisfied so i spent a few hours trawling the literature turns out theres simply no research on this topic we know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior its not even clear whether there exists a hiding behavioral program or if theyre just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attractionaversion biases in response to swats etc however after reading up on it i do think its safe to say that the majority of the huntinghiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned it turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for 24 days before they stop and spend several days digesting  laying eggs they typically repeat this huntrest cycle 34 times before they die furthermore a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed so in reality it typically only feeds on 15 people before stopping therefore even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us from a single mosquitos perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans less than 10 in its life cycle and over the course of only a few days that isnt a lot of data for the mosquito to learn with so if the possible answers to my original question are 1 its random 2 they have instinctdriven preferences for hiding with a lot of variation between regionsspecies or 3 they learn where to hide from experience we can probably rule out 3 x200b x200b,askscience,id50vn

when the atmospheric oxygen content increased 35 billion years ago where did that oxygen come from and did it replace another gas or did it just increase the mass of the atmosphere,in the present to my understanding oxygen in the atmosphere is produced by plants which do so using carbon dioxide and that phytoplankton were the primary cause of the massive jump in atmospheric oxygen content that happened during the archean my question is that given that there were basically only single celled organisms on earth where did the oxygen come from in the first place is it bonded in rocks and trapped in the crust and the phytoplankton were able to free it was it dissolved in the ocean was it somehow transported from another part of the galaxy such as in an meteor was there significantly more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and if there was carbon dioxide where did that come were there mono cellular organisms on earth already undergoing cellular respiration and if so where did they get the oxygen to do so in the first place,askscience,1emy3cc
does oxygen load onto haemoglobin sequentially or simultaneously,conflicting messages in the textbooks on this one i understand that cooperative binding occurs resulting in each sequential o2 bound to the hb tetramer to be easier to add than the previous however both the following seem plausible to me as a consequence of this phenomenon 1 hypothesis 1 the majority of haemoglobin exists fullysaturated oxyhemoglobin or fullydesaturated deoxyhaemoglobin with  saturations being based on a ratio of the two this is because oxygen will preferentially bind to haemoglobin molecules which have already overcome the relatively high energy barrier required to bind the first oxygen molecule 2 hypothesis 2 the  saturation represents a ratio of amount of oxygen carried by the haemoglobin and the amount that could be carried by the haemoglobin ie a population of hb molecules at 75 saturation would all contain a distribution of oxygen molecules centred on a mean of 3 under this hypothesis only the last fourth molecule tends to be loaded at the lungs and unloaded at the tissues so which one is it both seem plausible both are given as explanations in different sources only the former seems to be compatible with my understanding of how a pulse oximeter works,askscience,1d897gf

if iron loses its magnetism at around 1400f how is the earths core magnetic,after reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system i saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation due to its magnetism im not sure why i never queationed this before but as an amateur blacksmith i regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it also i know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal so i did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter neither of which i have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field i dont quite understand how it alone even if it were swirling could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core i also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them then i started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism so i researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours and it doesnt which brings me back to my original question only revised how is our inner core of iron plasma magnetic and why is important that it is iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow edit thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses i really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity the major points i have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat earths rotation radiation and even the moon we are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet does that kinda summ it up,askscience,69r3rt

does gravity have a range or speed,so light is a photon and it gets emitted by something like a star and it travels at 300000 kmsec in a vacuum i can understand this gravity on the other hand as i understand it isnt something thats emitted like some kind of tractor beam its a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object so what im wondering is is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of its gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object if very neglegable even if its a great distance away and if so does that gravity move at some kind of speed and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one additional mass isnt being created in such an event but is new gravity being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object i realize that its entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if thats the case this is something thats always interested me but i could never wrap my head around edit i did not expect this question to blow up like this this is amazing ive already learned more from reading some of these comments than i did in my senior year physics class id like to reply with a thank you to everyones comments but that would take a lot of time so let me just say thank you to all for sharing your knowledge here ill probably be reading this thread for days also special thank you to the individuals who sent silver and gold my way ive never had that happen on reddit before,askscience,g97dpz

why are plants able to propagate,with houseplants you can basically cut off a stem and place it in water or stick it in soil and it will eventually sprout roots in nature a stem or a branch will break off and land on the ground but then be disturbed by other factors such as wind and animals moving it around this disruption from my understanding doesnt give the stem a chance to root into the soil my question is how and why can plants propagate if it is not common in nature usually plant abilities have a purpose in their natural habitat eg carnivorous plants being carnivorous due to low nutrients in the habitat but if an ability is not needed in nature then why does the plant have it,askscience,1ereblm

in an open ac circuit without capacitive effects at the ends what happens from the point of view of the current,i understand that there are many ways to observe a small induced current in an open ac circuit for example  due to a capacitive effect in an open switch or due to the proximity of the two poles but imagine this scenario an ac circuit with two terminals that are far apart and completely isolated from the outside world in this scenario i wonder if there is still an infinitesimal current that flows indeed if i understand electrostatics correctly there are still very small displacements of electrons due to the change in voltage and the capacity of the wire by extension if we put a large capacitor on the branch  even in an open circuit i imagine that we will observe a current for a certain time i dont know if my intuition is correct or not if so how can this be calculated i am putting aside in this question the effects of radiation due to the antenna effect which would necessarily induce energy loss thank you,askscience,1edff6v
