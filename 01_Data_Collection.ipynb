Why won't Andromeda just keep moving through us and carry on its way?   \n",

My question is where does the original photon come from to start the chain reaction?   \n",

       "3  We are graduate students and faculty from the University of Washington Molecular Engineering and Science (MolES) PhD program. Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs to appear in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though our program only began in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!\\n\\nMolecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the behavior of something by precisely altering it on a molecular level - given knowledge of how the molecules in that \"something\" interact with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are limited only by your imagination! \\n\\nMolecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. We would like to spread awareness about its applications, as well as the exciting opportunities that come with it. \\n\\nAs a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to broaden the general awareness of our discipline!\\n\\nHere to answer your questions are:\\n\\n+ **Suzie Pun** - ( /u/MolESAMA-SuziePun ) - Professor of Bioengineering, Director of MolES Institute \\n  + Research area: drug delivery, biomaterials, aptamers\\n+ **Cole DeForest** - ( /u/profcole ) - Associate Professor of Bioengineering, MolES Director of Education\\n  + Research area: biomaterials, tissue engineering, drug delivery, protein engineering\\n+ **Andre Berndt** - ( /u/Mystic_Scientist ) - Assistant Professor of Bioengineering\\n  + Research area: protein engineering, optogenetics, neuroscience\\n+ **Jeff Nivala** - ( /u/technomolecularprof ) - Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering\\n  + Research area: nanopore, synbio, molecular data storage and computing\\n+ **David Bergsman** - ( /u/ProfBergsman ) - Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering\\n  + Research area: thin films, atomic layer deposition, nanomaterials, membrane separations, catalysis, interfacial engineering\\n+ **Doug Ballard** ( /u/UW-MolES ) - MolES Graduate Program Advisor\\n+ **Justin Daho Lee** ( /u/MolES-Justin ) - Sixth Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: protein engineering, optogenetics, neuroscience, stem cells\\n+ **Evan Pepper** ( /u/evanpepper ) - Fifth Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: microbiology, tuberculosis, antibiotic resistance\\n+ **Ben Nguyen** ( /u/nguyencd296 ) - Fifth Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: polymer chemistry, drug delivery\\n+ **Gaby Balistreri** ( /u/GB_2022 ) - Fourth Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: drug delivery, nanomedicine, nanoparticles, green engineering\\n+ **Ariel Lin** ( /u/MolEgradstudent ) - Third Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: open microfluidics, tissue engineering, bioanalytical chemistry, cell co-culture   \n",

I've learnt that a vacuum isn't really empty or still, but quantum waves constantly fluctuate and virtual particles pop in and out of existence. With so much hidden activity going on that seems like high entropy. But there aren't any real particles, which seems like it would be the lowest possible entropy. So now I'm wondering if it makes sense to apply entropy to a vacuum at all?   \n",

And what will happen if they suddenly stop revolving?   \n",

My question is where does the original photon come from to start the chain reaction?   \n",

      "3  We are graduate students and faculty from the University of Washington Molecular Engineering and Science (MolES) PhD program. Molecular Engineering is a new field; we were one of the first Molecular Engineering graduate programs to appear in the world, and one of only two in the United States. Though our program only began in 2014, we have had many discoveries to share!\\n\\nMolecular engineering itself is a broad and evolving field that seeks to understand how molecular properties and interactions can be manipulated to design and assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. Any time you attempt to change the behavior of something by precisely altering it on a molecular level - given knowledge of how the molecules in that \"something\" interact with one another - you're engaging in a type of molecular engineering. The applications are limited only by your imagination! \\n\\nMolecular engineering is recognized by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the areas of education and research most critical to ensuring the future economic, environmental and medical health of the U.S. We would like to spread awareness about its applications, as well as the exciting opportunities that come with it. \\n\\nAs a highly interdisciplinary field spanning across the science and engineering space, students of Molecular Engineering have produced numerous impactful scientific discoveries. We specifically believe that Molecular Engineering could be an exciting avenue for up-and-coming young scientists, and thus we would like to broaden the general awareness of our discipline!\\n\\nHere to answer your questions are:\\n\\n+ **Suzie Pun** - ( /u/MolESAMA-SuziePun ) - Professor of Bioengineering, Director of MolES Institute \\n  + Research area: drug delivery, biomaterials, aptamers\\n+ **Cole DeForest** - ( /u/profcole ) - Associate Professor of Bioengineering, MolES Director of Education\\n  + Research area: biomaterials, tissue engineering, drug delivery, protein engineering\\n+ **Andre Berndt** - ( /u/Mystic_Scientist ) - Assistant Professor of Bioengineering\\n  + Research area: protein engineering, optogenetics, neuroscience\\n+ **Jeff Nivala** - ( /u/technomolecularprof ) - Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering\\n  + Research area: nanopore, synbio, molecular data storage and computing\\n+ **David Bergsman** - ( /u/ProfBergsman ) - Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering\\n  + Research area: thin films, atomic layer deposition, nanomaterials, membrane separations, catalysis, interfacial engineering\\n+ **Doug Ballard** ( /u/UW-MolES ) - MolES Graduate Program Advisor\\n+ **Justin Daho Lee** ( /u/MolES-Justin ) - Sixth Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: protein engineering, optogenetics, neuroscience, stem cells\\n+ **Evan Pepper** ( /u/evanpepper ) - Fifth Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: microbiology, tuberculosis, antibiotic resistance\\n+ **Ben Nguyen** ( /u/nguyencd296 ) - Fifth Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: polymer chemistry, drug delivery\\n+ **Gaby Balistreri** ( /u/GB_2022 ) - Fourth Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: drug delivery, nanomedicine, nanoparticles, green engineering\\n+ **Ariel Lin** ( /u/MolEgradstudent ) - Third Year PhD Student\\n  + Research area: open microfluidics, tissue engineering, bioanalytical chemistry, cell co-culture   \n",

I've learnt that a vacuum isn't really empty or still, but quantum waves constantly fluctuate and virtual particles pop in and out of existence. With so much hidden activity going on that seems like high entropy. But there aren't any real particles, which seems like it would be the lowest possible entropy. So now I'm wondering if it makes sense to apply entropy to a vacuum at all?   \n",
